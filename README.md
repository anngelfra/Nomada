# [Nómada]

Nómada is a virtual window to home for those away: a digital multimedia experience of your hometown.


## Description

We all miss our home while we're away. Imagine being away for more than a few days, a few months... And to those who leave, having a glimpse of what's going on back home can be a relief: we want to give them this.
Nómada is a project that allows migrants - those nomads away - to access through the web a feed of media (videos, pictures, news) carefully curated to reflect what's going on in their hometown. Not only local news, but selected multimedia that will convert virtual content into feelings not only of your country, but of the little community you left to give a better life for. Your little community.
